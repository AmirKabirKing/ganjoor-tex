# ganjoor-tex

Ganjoor-TeX is a set of scripts to convert the content of the ganjoor.net (a Persian poetry website) into LaTeX files.

## Getting started

### Html to Text

The script `html2txt.py` reads the content of the ganjoor.net and creates text files.

```
usage: ./html2txt.py <ganjoor link> <txt directory>

example: ./html2txt.py https://ganjoor.net/moulavi/masnavi/daftar1/ moulavi/masnavi/daftar1/
```
